Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is using engineering methodology and principles to create, develop and maintain high-quality software applications.
It is very vital in the development of software applications and systems that are much-needed in the modern world.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
* Development of programming languages.
The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s.
The advent of structured programming in the 1970s.
The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements - This phase is where you get acquainted with the user's needs and the system's requirement
Design - This is the phase where you create a good and intuitive interface
Implementation - the coding phase
Testing - checking the software to see if it is standard and that it meets modern standard
Deployment - this is when it is made available for the users and the public
Maintenance - this is always checking the software qualities to see that it is updated and meets industry standards at all times

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The waterfall is a sequential approach with distinct phases like requirements, design, and implementation, flowing downwards like a waterfall while the Agile Methodology is an Iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A software developer is in charge of developing software using codes.
A Quality Assurance Engineer is in charge of ensuring software quality by designing and executing test plans.
While A project manager oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs are very useful tools for writing, debugging, and testing code. An example is Visual Studio.
Version Control Systems are software tools that are vital for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members. Examples include Git, and Subversion).

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing Requirements, Tight Deadlines, Technical Debt.
Strategies to overcome these challenges include effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing implies testing individual components or modules of software.
Integration Testing implies testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
System Testing implies testing the entire software system as a whole.
Acceptance Testing implies testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
Quality control measures help identify and fix defects early in the development process, leading to higher-quality software products.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the act of using the right text to get natural language responses from an AI or language model
Knowing prompt engineering is very key to getting the right response and not just any general view of what one wants to know.
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
"Define moral" To make it clear so that it won't give a general opinion on it, I can say, "Define morals according to the bible". THis improved prompt will enable the language model to know the direction from which it will answer the question or rather give response instead of just giving a general overview on what morals entail.
